    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Leo Tolstoy</p>

  <p>
    "God Sees the Truth but Waits" is a powerful short story written by the famous Russian author 
    Leo Tolstoy. It explores themes of fate, justice, forgiveness, and faith. 
    The story revolves around a young and honest merchant named Ivan Dmitrich Aksionov who lives 
    in the town of Vladimir. One day, while traveling to a fair, he meets another merchant. 
    They stay at the same inn, but the next morning, Aksionov is falsely accused of murdering the merchant 
    and stealing his money.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite his innocence, Aksionov is arrested, tried, and sentenced to twenty-six years of hard labor in Siberia. 
    Over the years, he transforms into a deeply religious man, gaining respect from fellow prisoners and guards alike.
    However, he remains sorrowful about the injustice he has suffered and loses hope of ever seeing his family again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many years later, a new prisoner named Makar Semyonich arrives. Aksionov eventually discovers 
    that Makar is the real murderer. At one point, Makar tries to escape from the prison by digging a tunnel, 
    but Aksionov refuses to report him, even though he knows about the plan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moved by Aksionov’s forgiveness and kindness, Makar confesses that he was the one who committed the crime 
    for which Aksionov was imprisoned. He begs Aksionov for forgiveness. Although Makar promises to tell the truth 
    to the authorities, Aksionov, at this point, feels that his soul is finally at peace. Before Aksionov could be freed, 
    he passes away in prison, finding true freedom through forgiveness and faith in God.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Theme:</strong>  
    The story teaches that although justice may be delayed, truth and divine justice always prevail in the end. 
    It also shows the strength of faith, the power of forgiveness, and the idea that suffering can lead to spiritual salvation.

<br><br>

<h4>b. Describe Aksionov&#8217;s character.</h4>
 Aksionov is the protagonist of the story &#8220;god sees the truth but waits&#8221; written by Leo Tolstoy. He is a young merchant. He is a handsome, fair-haired, curly-headed fellow, full of fun and very fond of singing. He used to drink much before marriage but later on, he changed himself and became a good man. He had virtuous qualities such as faith, forgiveness, freedom, and acceptance. His comfortable life is disrupted when he is framed for a murder he didn&#8217;t commit and was sent to a Siberian prison camp. He earns a reputation as a good person among the prison officials and fellow prisoners. After finding himself imprisoned with the man who framed him, Aksionov is ready to kill himself. However, at the end of the story, he is able to forgive Semyonich. He dies shortly before the authorities order him to be released.
<br><br>

<h4>c. What is the theme of the story?</h4>
In the story ‘God Sees the Truth, But Waits’ by Leo Tolstoy we have the theme of guilt, forgiveness, faith, conflict, freedom and acceptance. Narrated in the third person by an unnamed narrator the reader realizes after reading the story that Tolstoy may be exploring the theme of forgiveness.
<br>
<br>
If the plea of his wife to the Czar is denied, Aksionov realises that he cannot rectify his wrong. He
commits himself to God to offer him that righteousness which a man cannot give him.
<br>
<br>
Aksionov becomes a modest and pious person in jail. Officials and inmates appreciate him in settling
disputes for his neutrality. Aksionov&#8217;s trust in God is so great that he thinks that he must be wicked
to deserve God&#8217;s tortured life.
<br>
<br>
After Aksionov is reluctant to report the drilling of Semyonich&#8217;s tunnel, Semyonich is disturbed by the
compassion of Aksionov. Aksionov eventually gives forgiveness to Semyonich.
<br><br>

<h4>d. Which symbols are used in the story and what do they indicate?</h4>
The most important symbols in this short story are Aksionov&#8217;s house (and two shops) and the Siberian prison mine where he is sentenced to hard labor. His house and two shops represent his family, his material possessions, and his earthly affairs. The prison itself is a symbol of his suffering and his eventual spiritual transformation.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>
a. What role does religion play in Aksionov&#8217;s life? How does he undergo a spiritual transformation in
the story?
</h4>
 This story is all about Aksionov who lost hope and just trusted God. Though he didn’t commit any crime, he was imprisoned for 26 years. Makar revealed the truth that he was the real murderer. Aksionov forgave him for accepting the truth and attained self-realization. But when the order of his release came, he was already dead. Our weakness can only make the problem stronger. Being hopeful can make all things possible. The title means that every decision of God needs enough time. This story is for all those people who lose hope and don’t believe in God. We should wait for the truth to win with a faith in God. God gives us the answer to all our problems, as the title says ‘God Sees the Truth, But Waits’. At the end of the story there is a shift from materialism to spiritualism. 
<br><br>

<h4>b. What does the story tell us about the existence of an unfair system of justice?</h4>
 The story tell us about that one who commits the crime must be punished and kept in prison but not the innocent one. As here in the story, Aksionov did not commit any crime but he was kept in prison whereas the real murder Makar was not punished. Thus this story depicts about the unfair system of justice.
