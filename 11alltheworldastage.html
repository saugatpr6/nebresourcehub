    <h2>
        All The World’s A Stage
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Summary
    </h3>
    <h4>
        <br>
        <p>The poem begins by comparing the world to a stage, and people to actors who play different roles in the drama of life. The speaker, Jaques, states that each person enters the stage of life as a child, plays their role, and eventually leaves, just as an actor performs their role and exits the stage.</p>

  <h3>1. The First Stage - The Infant</h3>
  <p>The first stage of life is infancy. In this stage, the infant is helpless and dependent, "mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms." This stage symbolizes the vulnerability and need for care that every human begins with.</p>

  <h3>2. The Second Stage - The Schoolboy</h3>
  <p>The second stage is childhood, where the child is reluctant to go to school. This stage is marked by the child’s reluctance and resistance to education, symbolizing innocence mixed with the natural resistance to authority.</p>

  <h3>3. The Third Stage - The Lover</h3>
  <p>Next comes adolescence, symbolized by the lover who is often filled with intense emotions and romantic ideals. The lover "sighs like a furnace" and writes poetry for his beloved, expressing the passionate and idealistic nature of youth.</p>

  <h3>4. The Fourth Stage - The Soldier</h3>
  <p>The fourth stage is adulthood, where the person becomes a soldier, filled with ambition and a desire for honor. In this stage, people may pursue glory and recognition, but also face the risks and dangers of life, as indicated by the soldier’s willingness to "seek the bubble reputation" (symbolizing the fleeting nature of fame).</p>

  <h3>5. The Fifth Stage - The Justice</h3>
  <p>In middle age, a person becomes a justice, representing wisdom and the ability to make decisions. The "fair round belly" suggests a life of comfort and authority, where the person gains a sense of responsibility and takes on the role of guiding others with their knowledge and experience.</p>

  <h3>6. The Sixth Stage - The Old Man</h3>
  <p>The sixth stage of life is old age, characterized by physical decline and a loss of vitality. The "lean and slippered pantaloon" symbolizes the fragility and weariness of the elderly, who are often reduced to a state of weakness and dependency.</p>

  <h3>7. The Seventh Stage - The Second Childhood</h3>
  <p>The final stage is a return to helplessness, much like the first stage of life. In this stage, the elderly person becomes frail, losing their ability to function independently. They are "sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything," representing the ultimate decline of the human body.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>In conclusion, "All the World’s a Stage" offers a powerful reflection on the cyclical nature of life. By using the metaphor of life as a play, Shakespeare emphasizes the idea that people are merely players on the stage of life, each performing their roles for a limited time. The poem encourages reflection on the fleeting nature of life and the inevitable changes that everyone must face. Through Jaques’ monologue, Shakespeare highlights the inevitability of aging and the transient nature of human existence.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer the following questions.</h4>
<br>
<h4>a. Why does the poet compare the world with a stage?</h4>
The poet compares the world to a stage because he considers all men and women like the actors performing
their different roles here in this stage. By stage he means the world.
<br><br>

<h4>b. What is the first stage in a human&#8217;s life? In what sense can it be a troubling stage?</h4>
The first stage in a human&#8217;s life is childhood. It can be a troubling stage in the sense that this stage is
a fully dependent stage and the infant can cry and even vomit anytime in mother&#8217;s arms.
<br><br>

<h4>c. Describe the second stage of life based on the poem.</h4>
The second stage of life is the stage of boyhood. In this stage, the boy is a school going student. He
complains all the time. His face is like shinning morning. He carries his bag and reluctantly goes to school as
slowly as a snail.
<br><br>

<h4>d. Why is the last stage called second childhood?</h4>
The last stage is called second childhood because in this stage the man loses his senses of sight, hearing,
smell and taste and behaves as like a child.
<br><br>

<h4>e. In what sense are we the players in the world stage?</h4>
We are the players in the world stage as we appear on the world stage when we get birth and leave it when
we die like the actors do on the stage in a theater.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br>
<h4>a. Explain the following lines:</h4>
<i>
All the world&#8217;s a stage,
<br>
And all the men and women merely players
</i>
<br>
In the given lines, the poet has compared the whole world with a stage where men and women are the actors.
After birth, every person perform their roles here in this worldly stage and finally, leave this stage moving
towards their final destination called death.
<br><br>

<h4>b. Explain the following lines briefly with Reference to the context.</h4>
<i>
They have their exits and their entrances;
<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,
</i>
<br>
The given lines are taken from the poem ‘All the world’s a stage’, composed by William Shakespeare. These
lines express similarity between the roles the actors play on the stage and humans in their lives.
<br><br>
Here, the poet has said that the people arrive here in this worldly stage through birth and leave this stage through
death. Like the actors in a drama, we are assigned various roles to be performed. When we get our roles completed we
quit the stage of our life. The poet wants us to realize the fact that human life is like the stage of a theatre. A
man is fated to act several roles in his life.
<br><br>

<h4>c. Read the given lines and answer the questions that follow.</h4>
<i>
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
<br>
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
<br>
Unwillingly to school.
</i>
<br><br>
<b>i. Which stage of life is being referred to here by the poet?</b>
<br>
The childhood stage of life is being referred to here by the poet.
<br><br>
<b>ii. Which figure of speech has been employed in the second line?</b>
<br>
In the second line, simile, a figure of speech has been employed where the boy has been
compared with snail using like.
<br><br>
<b>iii. Who is compared to the snail?</b>
<br>
The school-going boy is compared to the snail.
<br><br>
<b>iv. Does the boy go to the school willingly?</b>
<br>
No, the boy doesn&#8217;t go to the school willingly. His unwillingness can easily be the motion of
snail towards his school.
<br><br>

<h4>
d. Simile and metaphor are the two major poetic devices used in this poem. Explain citing examples of
each.
</h4>
Here in this poem, we find major poetic devices as simile and metaphor. The poet has used these
poetic devices a lot. The examples of simile and metaphor of this poem are as follows:
<br><br>
a) &quot;All the world&#8217;s a stage&quot; &#8211; Metaphor
<br>
b) &quot;And all the men and women merely players&quot; &#8211; Metaphor
<br>
c) &quot;And shining morning face, creeping like a snail&quot; &#8211; Simile
<br>
d) &quot;Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,&quot; &#8211; Simile
<br>
e) &quot;Seeking the bubble reputation&quot; &#8211; Metaphor
<br>
f) &quot;His youthful hose, well sav&#8217;d, a world too wide&quot; &#8211; Metaphor.
<br>
g) &quot;and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble&quot; &#8211; Metaphor.
<br><br>

<h4>
e. Which style does the poet use to express his emotions about how he thinks that the world is a stage
and all the people living in it are mere players?
</h4>
The poem is written in blank verse with regular metrical but unrhymed lines. The style of the poem is narrative. In this poem he has expressed his innermost emotions about how he thinks that the world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players or characters. These characters go through seven different phases in their lives. He has explained the real aspects of human life for all readers to understand the reality of life.
<br><br>

<h4>f. What is the theme of this poem?</h4>
In ‘All the world’s a stage’ Shakespeare discusses the futility of humanity’s place in the world. He explores themes of time, aging, memory, and the purpose of life. Through the monologue’s central conceit, that everyone is simply a player in a larger game that they have no control over, he brings the themes together. Shakespeare takes the reader through the stages of life, starting with infancy and childhood and ending up with an old man who’s been a lover, a soldier, and a judge. The “man” dies after reverting back to a state that’s close to childhood and infancy.
<br><br>

<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>
a. Describe the various stages of human life picturised in the poem &quot;All the world&#8217;s a
stage.&quot;
</h4>
 According to Shakespeare, the world is a stage and everyone is a player. He says that every man has seven stages during his lifetime. The first stage of a man is childhood. He plays in the arms of his mother. He often vomits and cries in this stage. In his second stage, the man is an unwilling school going student. He becomes a lover in his third stage. He is very busy composing ballads for his beloved and yearns for her attention. In the fourth stage, he is aggressive and ambitious. He seeks reputation in all that he does. He is ready to guard his country and becomes a soldier. In his fifth stage, he becomes a fair judge with maturity and wisdom. In the sixth stage, he is seen with loose pantaloons and spectacles. His manly voice changes into a childish treble. The last stage of all is his second childhood. Slowly, he loses his faculties of sight, hearing, smell and taste and exits from the roles of his life. Thus, Shakespeare has presented the pictures of the seven stages of a man’s life in the poem ‘All the World’s a Stage.&#8217;
<br><br>

<h4>b. Is Shakespeare&#8217;s comparison of human&#8217;s life with a drama stage apt? How?</h4>
 Shakespeare has compared human life to a play or drama played by every man and woman. He has described
seven stages of life, which are like the seven acts of a play.
<br><br>
The comparison of the world to a stage and people to actors goes before Shakespeare. We find such comparisons made
in many philosophical books too.
<br><br>
But, even if nobody had written about it, it is by a simple observation of life around us we find the same thing
happening. Everybody takes birth, grows, and with every growth, man&#8217;s life changes. He works, fulfils duties and
responsibilities according to age, and finally leaves the world.
<br><br>
This simple observation tells us Shakespeare&#8217;s comparison of human life with a drama is very apt.
