    <h2>The Selfish Giant</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            "The Selfish Giant" is a beautiful short story by Oscar Wilde that conveys a strong message about love, kindness, and the importance of sharing. 
            The story revolves around a giant who owns a lovely garden, where children used to come and play joyfully. 
            However, the giant, being selfish, builds a huge wall around the garden to keep the children out.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            After the children are forbidden, the garden falls into eternal winter — no flowers bloom, no birds sing, and the place becomes cold and lifeless. 
            The selfishness of the giant turns the once lively garden into a dead and sorrowful place. 
            One day, the giant notices that spring has returned to parts of the garden where the children have sneaked in through a hole in the wall.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Realizing his mistake, the giant’s heart melts with love and he knocks down the wall, inviting the children back. 
            Once again, the garden becomes vibrant with life, full of flowers and happiness. 
            The giant becomes friends with the children and learns the true joy of giving and sharing.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Towards the end, the giant meets a special child who symbolizes divine love and salvation. 
            After living a happy life by sharing his garden, the giant peacefully passes away and is taken to paradise.
          </p>
        
          <h3>Moral of the Story</h3>
          <p>
            The story teaches that selfishness leads to loneliness and sorrow, while love, kindness, and generosity bring happiness and peace.

The practice of representing the objects, qualities etc. as the human beings in art and literature is called personification. Three examples of personification from the story are the beautiful little flowers who slips back into the garden after seeing the notice board, the snow and the frost who says that the spring has forgotten this garden. 
<br>
<br>
The story has the significance of the seasons personified. At the beginning, the seasons bless the garden with pleasant weather until the Giant sends the children away from his garden. Because of the Giant&#8217;s unkindness to the children, the spring season leaves the garden. The seasons disfavor indicates that the Giant&#8217;s selfishness goes against the natural order and thus deserves punishment. Thus the significance of the seasons personification is to show that if someone does bad then he/she will deserve the bad.
<br><br>

<br><br>

As a fairy tale, the story is full of figures of speech. The figure of speech is used for ‘winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail and little child’ is personification. The little child is compared to the God Almighty (Paradise).
<br><br><br>

<h3>Reference beyond text</h3>
<br>
<h4>a. What is the main theme of the story?</h4>
The main theme of this story is selfishness and love. It is the story of transformation of selfish giant into selfless giant. At the beginning of the story, the giant was very selfish and wicked towards the children and he closes the gate of beautiful garden for them. But later he realizes his mistake when the children stop coming to the garden and the garden never experiences the spring season until and unless he allows them to play in his garden. At this point he realizes the meaning of love and sharing. This story is very much relatable to the nature of human beings. We hardly share our belongings to anyone if somebody is needy and we are selfish too. This story teaches us to share love and compassion to get love in return.
<br>
<br>
<h4>b. Does God punish those who are cruel to children and very selfish?</h4>
Yes, God punishes those who are cruel to children and very selfish. As in the story, Giant has really been so cruel to the children and selfish and he didn’t let them play on the garden because of which spring never came in his garden. In the absence of children birds also did not sing. Once a flower bloomed out of the grass but after seeing the notice board, it also went back to sleep. Then came the North Wind and the hailstorm. Due to the giant’s selfishness, autumn’s golden fruits also did not come to his garden. In this way god punishes to those who are cruel to children and very selfish.
