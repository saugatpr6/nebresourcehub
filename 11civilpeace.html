    <h2>Civil Peace</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Chinua Achebe</p>

        <p><strong>Setting:</strong> "Civil Peace" is set in post-civil war Nigeria, during the time when the country is recovering from the devastating effects of the Nigerian Civil War. The story shows the struggle of ordinary people trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of the conflict.</p>
      
        <p>The protagonist of the story is Jonathan Iwegbu, a hardworking and optimistic man who, despite the destruction of the civil war, is grateful for what he has. He feels fortunate that he and his family survived the war, and that his bicycle, which he calls a "miracle," was not destroyed.</p>
      
        <p><strong>Jonathan's Family and Rebuilding Their Lives:</strong> 
          After the war ends, Jonathan returns to his home and finds that it has not been completely destroyed. Despite the loss of many things, his family is alive. Jonathan’s immediate goal is to rebuild his life and provide for his family. He starts by using his bicycle to offer taxi services, taking passengers from one place to another for a small fee. This allows him to earn money and start his journey toward recovery.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          As the days go by, Jonathan continues working hard to make ends meet. He later takes the money he earned from the bicycle work and uses it to open a small bar, selling palm wine to local customers. His efforts and the support of his family help them survive, and they slowly begin to rebuild their lives after the devastation of the war.
        </p>
      
        <p><strong>The Government's Help:</strong>
          Jonathan, like many others, receives a small payment from the government as part of the country’s efforts to assist people affected by the war. Jonathan is given 20 pounds, which is a small amount but still valuable. He sees this money as a sign that things are improving, and he is filled with hope for the future. He plans to use the 20 pounds to further improve his family's living conditions.
        </p>
      
        <p><strong>The Robbery:</strong>
          One night, when Jonathan is at home with his wife and children, a group of thieves breaks into their house. They demand the 20 pounds that Jonathan received from the government. Jonathan, though frightened, remains calm. He does not resist the thieves but instead gives them the money without protest. He hopes that by doing so, they will leave peacefully without harming anyone in his family.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          After the thieves take the money and leave, Jonathan and his family are shaken but not defeated. Jonathan reflects on the robbery and says, “Nothing puzzles God.” His words show his belief that, while things may seem unfair or difficult at times, it is important to trust in a higher power and keep moving forward with hope. Jonathan’s resilience and positive attitude help him deal with the loss, and he refuses to let the robbery bring him down.
        </p>
      
        <p><strong>Jonathan's Attitude and Outlook:</strong>
          Despite the theft, Jonathan remains optimistic. He does not dwell on the loss of the money, and he refuses to let it affect his mood or his sense of hope. He tells his wife that "It’s not a big loss," because they still have each other and they still have their health. This shows Jonathan's strength and ability to focus on what is important in life. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Jonathan’s positive attitude is a key theme in the story. Even though he has experienced hardship and loss, he remains hopeful and determined to keep going. He teaches us the importance of resilience, gratitude, and the ability to see the good in life, even when things are tough.
        </p>
      
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong> 
          "Civil Peace" is a story about survival, hope, and the human spirit. The main theme of the story is about the resilience and determination of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The story demonstrates how, even after suffering great losses, it is possible to rebuild and find peace. Jonathan's ability to remain calm, positive, and hopeful, even after the robbery, shows his strength of character and his belief that life goes on.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Another important theme in the story is the idea of peace. The title "Civil Peace" reflects the fragile nature of peace in post-war societies. Jonathan’s survival and ability to move on after the robbery show that, even in times of difficulty, it is possible to create a sense of peace in one’s own life. While the government offers material help, it is Jonathan’s personal strength and his family’s unity that truly help him find peace in his life after the war.
        </p>
      
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 
          In conclusion, Chinua Achebe’s "Civil Peace" highlights the importance of maintaining hope and resilience, even when life is difficult. Through Jonathan’s journey, we learn that, no matter what challenges we face, it is our inner strength and determination that will help us survive and rebuild. The story teaches us that peace is not just the absence of conflict, but a state of mind and the ability to move forward with hope.

<h3>Understanding the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer the following questions.</h4>
<br>
<h4>a. Why did Jonathan think of himself as &lsquo;extraordinarily lucky&rsquo;?</h4>

three out of their four children. That means he is grateful for the survival of five family members.
<br>
<br>
<h4>c. Why did Jonathan mistrust the officer who wanted to take his bicycle? What does this tell you about the
situation in Nigeria?</h4>
Jonathan mistrusted the officer who wanted to take his bicycle because the officer easily accepted bribe
exchange of his bicycle. This tells us that the situation of Nigeria was so much worse as the government officers
were corrupted and used to take bribes from the citizens.
<br>
<br>
<h4>d. What visitors might be at the door? Are Jonathan and his wife completely surprised? Explain.</h4>
The visitors who knock at the door of Jonathan’s house might be the thieves. Jonathan and his wife are
completely shocked due to fear as it was midnight and the thieves are knocking at the door violently.

<br>
<h4>
e. Why does no one in the neighborhood respond when the thieves pound on Jonathan&rsquo;s door? Why do
the thieves call for the police?
</h4>
No one in the neighborhood responds when the thieves pound on Jonathan’s door because they are scared of
the thieves. The thieves called for the police because they knew very well that no one will come to support
Jonathan’s family.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Reference in the context</h3>
<br>
<h4>
a. What does Jonathan mean by his expression &ldquo;Nothing puzzles God&rdquo;? What does this
expression reveal about his character? Explain by citing details from the story.
</h4>
In the story &#8220;Civil Peace&#8221;, Jonathan uses this expression &#8220;Nothing puzzles God&#8221; every time when something
miraculous happens with him. He uses this line when he gets his bicycle back in fine condition out of the ground.
Next, he uses it when he finds his house is still standing after the war. By “Nothing puzzles God” he means that
anything can happen, but Almighty God, being omniscient, is not surprised and puzzled by anything which means that
God knows each and every thing. The last time he uses it at the end of the story after his family is robbed of the
exgratia. This expression reveals that he is quite optimistic person who has been believing in God. He feels too
delighted to get miracles in his life. This expression also reveals that he is a good person who enjoys everything
he has but never laments on his loses. Therefore, his character was optimistic, hopeful and religious.
<br>
<br>
<h4>b. How does Jonathan change as he experiences the conflicts in his life? Explain.</h4>
Jonathan is a hardworking person who believes in his hard labour as well as god the most. He is quite
optimistic person who never loses his hope. He has experienced many conflicts in his life. He has lost his child
during the war but he believes himself lucky to get 5 inestimable blessings. Jonathan keeps on doing his hard labour
for the sake and welfare of his family keeping faith or believes in God. He changes according to the demands of the
time and his own family needs.
<br>
<br>
<h4>c. Read the extract and answer the questions below.</h4>
&ldquo;To God who made me; if you come inside and find one hundred pounds, take it and shoot me and
shoot my wife and children. I swear to God. The only money I have in this life is this twenty pounds
egg-rasher they gave me today &#8230;&rdquo;
<br>
<br>
<h4>i. Who is the speaker?</h4>
Jonathan is the speaker.
<br>
<br>
<h4>ii. Who is the speaker talking to?</h4>
The speaker is talking to the thieves or robbers.
<br>
<br>
<h4>iii. Who does &ldquo;they&rdquo; refer to?</h4>
&quot;They&quot; refers to the officials of the treasury i.e. the government.
<br><br>

<h4>
d. Nigerian English has words like soja &#8216;soldier&#8217; and katakata &#8216;confusion&#8217;, &#8216;trouble&#8217; derived apparently
from English words but transformed by native languages&#8217; phonologies. What does the author&rsquo;s use of
dialect here add to the story?
</h4>
Nigerian English has words like Soja &#8220;soldier&#8221; and katakata &#8220;confusion&#8221;, &#8220;trouble&#8221; delivered apparently
from English words but transformed by Native language phonologies. The author added dialects here in the story
because of the following reasons:
<br><br>
&#8211; To focus on the native language
<br>
&#8211; To promote the dialects
<br>
&#8211; To know the status of living people in Nigeria
<br>
&#8211; To promote the nationality
<br>
<br>
<h4>
e. Why do you think the thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan does?
</h4>
The thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan does to show that they were white Americans so that no one could doubt on them and also to prove their superiority.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
f. The title of the story &quot;Civil Peace&quot; itself is ironical as there is little to differentiate
&lsquo;civil peace&rsquo; from &lsquo;civil war&rsquo;. Do you think that the title of this story is
appropriate, or would &ldquo;Civil War&rdquo; have been a better title? Explain.
</h4>
The title of the story &#8220;Civil Peace&#8221; is especially interesting because it is used in an ironic sense. The story follows Jonathan Iwegbu as he collects the fragments of his life after the end of the Nigerian Civil War. The Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War, was a protracted conflict that resulted because a section of Nigeria attempted to secede and form its own country. The war leaves a tremendous amount of destruction in its wake, and Jonathan gathers up what he can to reestablish his life. The title of the story is ironic because even though the war has come to an end, the area is still chaotic and filled with strife. Indeed, a gang of robbers use the term “civil peace” when they rob Iwegbu and his family in the dead of night. Thus, Achebe uses the title ironically to highlight the violence still present in a post-war Nigeria.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>a. How would you describe the civil peace in Nigeria?</h4>
The condition of the Civil please in Nigeria wasn&#8217;t good. After the war, the time of the civil peace was the time of the resettlement.There was nothing new for the people.People had to face various problems during that time.The government&#8217;s law during that time was good.There were many risks in people&#8217;s life.Thieves used to do loots and beat people without having any fear of law.Though the Civil piece prevailed there, there was Anarchy everywhere.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
b. What kind of attitude towards life do you think you would have if your situation was similar to that
of Jonathan&rsquo;s?
</h4>
 If my situation was similar to that of Jonathan&#8217;s, I would have similar optimism about my life and my family. I would be ready to face any challenges so as to protect my family as like Jonathan did. I would try to do hard labour keeping faith in God for the welfare of my relatives. I would try to be quite away from violence. Hence I think that I would have positive, optimist and energetic attitude towards life if my situation was similar to that of Jonathan’s.
<br>
<br>
<h4>c. Draw the character sketch of Jonathan Iwegbu.</h4>
Jonathan Iwegbu- Jonathan is a round character. His main trait is optimism, however some of his smaller traits are, peacefulness, persuasiveness, and calmness. He is a static character; he stays the same through the whole story. He does not waste his time to look back on the things that have troubled him in the past, he keeps calm and carries on with his life and deals with whatever happens next. His optimism is shown with every main event in the story.
<br>
<br>
First off, the war has ended. He is happy to come out of it alive with his wife, his bike, and three out of four of his children; one child has died. The fact that his child has died does not seem to trouble him on the outside. It probably does on the inside, however, he does not let it get to him. He stops thinking about it and instead of being upset because of the death of his child, he is happy for everyone that has survived. Also, he refers to his bike as a taxi once, which shows more optimism.
<br>
<br>
When he gets to his old house it is broken down. He is calm and gathers up some materials to fix it instead of getting mad over it.
<br>
<br>
His old job as a minor isn&#8217;t available anymore, so he starts a new job of his own and opens up a bar.
<br>
<br>
Thieves come to his house and try to rob him of money. He tries to find the most peaceful way out of it. After paying all the money he had he once again, he remains calm and carries on.
