    <h2>A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings</h2>
    <h3>summary</h3>
    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Gabriel García Márquez</p>

    <p>
        <em>"A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings"</em> is a short story by Gabriel García Márquez, known for its magical realism. The 
        narrative begins when Pelayo and his wife, Elisenda, discover an old man with enormous wings in their backyard after a storm. 
        The man is weak, disoriented, and looks angelic, but he does not speak. The couple locks him in a chicken coop, and soon, the 
        villagers flock to see the strange figure.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the people examine him, they are torn between seeing him as a miracle or a curse. The local priest arrives and concludes 
        that the old man must be an angel sent to test the faith of the villagers, though his appearance seems contradictory to what 
        the villagers expect an angel to look like. As the story progresses, Pelayo and Elisenda exploit the old man, charging people 
        to see him. This business venture brings them wealth, but they do not show him kindness or compassion. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Eventually, the old man grows weaker, and the villagers lose interest in him when a new attraction arrives in the form of a 
        woman who has the body of a spider. The old man recovers and, despite the mistreatment, he suddenly spreads his wings and 
        flies away. The couple continues their life with the wealth they gained, while the town remains unchanged, indifferent to 
        the miraculous event.
    </p>

    <p>
        The story is rich in symbolism, exploring themes of <strong>human cruelty, exploitation, religious faith, and the nature of 
        miracles</strong>. It illustrates how society often fails to recognize the true significance of extraordinary events and 
        instead chooses to focus on personal gain and selfish desires. The old man’s quiet departure represents how miracles, 
        when misunderstood or mistreated, may fade into obscurity, leaving behind only those unchanged by the miraculous.

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Answer the following questions.</h4>
    <h4>a. How does the narrator describe the weather and its effects in the exposition of the story?</h4>
    The narrator set up the picture of a rainy day to describe the weather and its effects in the exposition of the
    story. The rain falls continuously for three days and makes the land and houses filled with rainwater. During the
    rainy season, the sky and sea were changed into ash grey colour and the sand of the shore glimmered like powdered
    light, which had become a hash of mud and rotten shellfish. The light sparked was so weak and hard to see.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h4>b. Describe the strange old man as Pelayo and his wife first encounter within their courtyard.</h4>
    When Pelayo and his wife first encountered the strange old man, they noticed him dressed in the manner of a rag
    picker. He had a bald head and looked almost completely shaved. His mouth was almost empty with no sans teeth
    remaining. His large and dirty buzzard wings were half-plucked and entangled in mud.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h4>c. Why did Pelayo and Elisenda imprison the old man in the chicken coop?</h4>
    Pelayo and Elisenda imprisoned the old man in the chicken coop thinking that he is an angel and he was there to take
    their child.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h4>d. Why was Father Gonzaga not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger?</h4>
    Father Gonzaga Was not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger because the old man didn&#8217;t know how to
    greet ministers and also didn&#8217;t understand the language of god. Father noticed this when he said good morning in
    Latin, he just murmured something in his dialect which father didn&#8217;t understand.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>e. Many people gathered at Pelayo’s house to see the strange old man. Why do you think the crowd
    assembled to see him?</h4>
    Many people gathered at Pelayo&#8217;s house to see the strange old man because he was unique and strange with his buzzard
    wings. People thought of him as an angel or messenger of god and thought of making some fun with him.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h4>f. Some miracles happened while the crowd gathers to see the strange man. What are these miracles?</h4>
    In the story, it is mentioned that some miracles happened while the crowd gathers to see the strange man. Those
    miracles were the blind man who couldn&#8217;t recover his eyes but grew three new teeth, the paralytic person who
    couldn&#8217;t walk but almost won the lottery and the leper whose shore flourished sunflowers.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h4>g. State the irritating things that the people did with the strange old man.</h4>
    The people gathered at Pelayo’s house also did some inhuman and teasing tasks with the strange old man. Such
    irritating things include throwing stones at the old man and burning his side with an iron rod. Which made him
    injured and he was not capable of moving. He laid there like a dead man for half an hour and woke up full of tears.
    People pulled his feathers too.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h4>h. How and why was the woman changed into a spider?</h4>
    The reason behind the changing of the woman into a spider is lightning. Without any permission, she went out to
    dance and when she was returning from the forest a massive lightning strike shattered the sky and a bolt of
    brimstone hit and converted her into a spider.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h4>i. Describe how Elisenda saw the strange man flying over the houses?</h4>
    Elisenda saw the strange man flying over the house from her windows while she was chopping vegetables in the
    kitchen. While doing so, she felt a breeze and moved to the window to check whether it is. She then saw the elderly
    guy was trying to fly and after a while, she saw that he succeeded to fly and vanished as quickly.

    <h3>Reference to text</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>a. The arrival of a strange old man at Pelayo’s courtyard arouses many suspicions and explanations.
    Explain how the neighbour woman, Father Gonzaga and the doctor speak of the strange man. Why do you think these
    three people give three different kinds of interpretations?</h4>
    The appearance of a strange old man at Pelayo’s courtyard produces many suspicions and explanations. According
    to the neighbour woman, he was an “angel” who came for their child, but the poor fellow is so old that
    the rain knocked him down. When Father said Good Morning in Latin, he muttered something in his dialect which father
    couldn’t understand.
    <br><br>
    
    Father Gonzaga was not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger because he (old man) did not understand
    the language of God or know how to greet His ministers. He looked much too human, he had an intolerable smell of the
    outdoors, and the backside of his wings was sprinkled with parasites. There was nothing about him measured up to the
    proud dignity of angels. So Father told to the viewer that an old man who has wings wasn’t an angel. But the
    crowd didn’t pay attention to Father Gonzaga.
    <br><br>
    
    According to the doctor, the strange man couldn’t be alive for a long time. He found so much whistling in the
    heart and so many sounds in his kidneys. It seemed the body of an angel was complete as a human organism but he
    couldn’t understand why other men didn’t have them too.
    <br><br>
    
    In my opinion, these three people give three different kinds of variations to a strange old man because they are all
    involved in different types of activities and they all see the strange old man with their different views. An old
    woman believes in things like an angel, ghosts, etc. Father Gonzaga was a person who believed in god and interpreted
    everything with proof. And a doctor was a person who see the strange old man as his patient.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>b. This story belongs to the genre of ‘magical realism, a genre perfected by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in
    his novels and short stories. Magical realism is a narrative technique in which the storyteller narrates the
    commonplace things with magical colour and the events look both magical and real at the same time. Collect five
    magic realist happenings from the story and argue why they seem magical to you.</h4>
    The story ‘a very old man with enormous wings’ belongs to the genre of ‘magical realism&#8217;, a genre
    perfected by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his novels. Following are the five magic realist happenings from the story:
    <br><br>
    
    At the beginning of the story Pelayo saw a very old man, lying face down in the mud in his garden who couldn’t
    get up in spite of his tremendous efforts which also had wings. The writer here uses Magical realism techniques
    through the word ‘enormous wings’ of an old man. This show that an old man belongs to another universe
    or world.
    <br><br>
    
    When Pelayo and Elisenda tried to talk with the strange old man, he answered in an unbelievable dialect with a
    strong voice. It shows the example of a magical link in the sense that he was from another mysterious world.
    <br><br>
    
    After seeing the old man, the old woman called him the “angel” who came for their child, but the old man
    is so old that the rain knocked him down. The word ‘angel’ itself justifies the magical link in the
    story.
    <br><br>
    
    The modification of the woman in spider for having disobeyed her parents by going out to dance without any
    permission to a spider. In his childhood, she had crept out of her parent’s house to go to a dance, and while
    she was coming back through the dark forest after having danced all night without permission, a massive thunderclap
    hit and through the crack came the lightning bolt of brimstone that changed her into a spider. This also links the
    story to magical realism techniques.
    <br><br>
    
    As shown by the story, the doctor failed to treat the old man. According to the doctor, the strange man
    couldn’t be alive for a long time. He found so much whistling in the heart and so many sounds in his kidneys.
    An old man became weak and sick. His feathers had fallen down. But quickly his feathers regrow again and fly in the
    sky. This also links the story to magical realism.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>c. The author introduces the episode of a woman who became a spider for having disobeyed her parents. This
    episode at once shifts people’s concentration from the strange old man to the spider woman. What do you
    think is the purpose of the author to bring this shift in the story?</h4>
    The author introduces the episode of a woman who became a spider for having disregarded her parents by going outside
    to dance without any permission. The scene of shifting a woman into a spider is somewhat breaking the attention of
    an old man, I think, the author brought this shift in the story is to show another example of magical realism. The
    intention of the author was to show us the greed of humans. In the beginning, Pelayo, and Elisenda take care of a
    strange old man when they benefit from him by charging five cents admission to see. But when a spider woman comes
    and people pay less attention to an angel, they do not care about him. Old man drags here and there. The house of an
    old man collapse due to rain and sun but they didn&#8217;t repair it.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>d. The story deals with the common people’s gullibility. How do Pelayo and his wife take advantage of
    common people’s whim?</h4>
    The story ‘A Very Old man with Enormous Wings’ deals with the common people’s gullibility. Pelayo
    and his wife saw an old man with wings in their garden. When they wanted to talk with him, he answered in an
    impenetrable dialect with a strong voice. They were unable to understand his language. So they called an old woman
    who was a witch. She called an old man an “angel” who come to take their child but he is so old that the
    rain knocked him down. Pelayo pulled him out of the mud and locked him up with the hens in the wire chicken coop. A
    short time afterwards the child woke up without a fever and with a desire to eat. They now felt like magic just
    happened. Then they felt generous and decided to put the old man on a raft with fresh water and provisions for three
    days and leave him to his fate on the high seas.
    <br><br>
    
    But when they get early in the morning and saw that, their courtyard was full of crowds and they were amazed by
    seeing that. The news of the angel spread like a fire. People didn’t even listen to Father Gonzaga’s
    voice that he was not an angel. Pelayo’s wife got an idea to charge five cents admission to see an angel. They
    gathered a lot of wealth from it and built a luxurious house for themselves.
