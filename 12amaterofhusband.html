    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Ferenc Molnár</p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> One-act play</p>
    <p><strong>Setting:</strong> The drawing room of a famous Hungarian actress</p>

    <p><em>"A Matter of Husbands"</em> is a witty one-act play by Hungarian playwright Ferenc Molnár. The narrative unfolds in the drawing room of a renowned actress, where the central characters—a young, earnest woman and the famous actress—engage in a conversation that reveals the complexities of relationships and the art of deception.</p>

    <p>The play opens with the earnest young woman anxiously waiting in the actress's drawing room. She is distraught, believing that her husband, Alfred, a lawyer, has been unfaithful to her with the actress. Upon the actress's arrival, the young woman confronts her, demanding that she return her husband.</p>

    <p>The actress, maintaining composure, denies any romantic involvement with Alfred. She explains that she knows him professionally, as he is handling a legal matter for her. The young woman insists that Alfred has been sending her flowers and letters, which she believes are signs of an affair.</p>

    <p>In response, the actress spins a tale, suggesting that Alfred is merely trying to make his wife jealous to rekindle their relationship. She portrays the situation as a common theatrical ruse, where men use actresses to provoke jealousy in their wives.</p>

    <p>Initially skeptical, the earnest young woman begins to believe the actress's story. She apologizes for her earlier accusations and expresses gratitude for the actress's understanding. As she prepares to leave, the actress calls out to Alfred, who emerges from the closet, revealing that he has been hiding there throughout the conversation.</p>

    <p>The play concludes with the revelation that the actress and Alfred were indeed involved, and the entire scenario was a staged act to manipulate the young woman. This twist highlights themes of deception, jealousy, and the blurred lines between reality and performance.</p>

I feel the famous Actress is really good at acting when she tells the Earnest Young Woman that her husband is
playing a game upon her to make her jealous so that she will change her personality and can try to impress him her

<br>
<br>
<h4>g. Write down the plot of the play in a paragraph.</h4>
A Matter of Husbands is a one-act written by most celebrated and controversial play wright Ferenc Molnar. This play
sheds light on the role of actors on the stage and in real life and how much they are capable of keeping us in an
illusion.
<br>
<br>
In the beginning, the Earnest Young Woman rushes to the Famous Actress angrily, asking her to return her husband.
The famous Actress boldly denies, that she has stolen her husband. She says she knows him because once the contract
for a case has given to him. Earnest Young Woman tells her that her husband sends her flowers and writes love
letter. She reads her husband&#8217;s love letter for the actress.
<br>
<br>
Upon the circumstance, the actress smiles and still begins to deny that she has received any flowers or any letters
from him. Now she fools Earnest Young Woman by saying that a misunderstanding may have arrived between her and her
husband. She makes Earnest Young Woman believe that her husband has been playing with her to make her jealous and
gain her love back. Then, the Earnest Young woman innocently realizes her misdeed and begs sorry with her. Earnest
Young Woman leaves the stage and the famous Actress calls Alfred to come out of her boudoir.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br>
<h4>a. Sketch the character of Famous Actress.</h4>
The Famous Actress is a young, renowned, and beautiful actress who is envied by the ordinary woman. On the outside,
she looks innocent and harmless but in reality, she is mean and wicked. She is cunning and deceitful as seen in the
way she concocts a story to sway the woman from believing that her husband was having an affair with her. She also
lives an immoral life as seen in the conclusion of the story where it was revealed that Alfred, the ordinary woman&#8217;s
husband was actually in her house.
<br>
<br>
<h4>b. Shed light on the difference between an ordinary woman and an actress.</h4>
In the story, &#8220;A Matter of Husband&#8221;, the ordinary woman is portrayed as a simple-minded and timid person
who was easily deceived by the false story told by the actress. She had come to the actress in tears completely sure
that her husband was having an affair with the actress. However, the actress told a story to her of how her husband
was trying to regain the love he had for her by doing things to get her jealous. Without asking questions, the
ordinary woman believed her and bought into the story. In the end, it was revealed that her husband was actually in
the actress&#8217;s room. This shows that the actress was cunning while the ordinary woman was timid.
<br>
<br>
<h4>c. According to Famous Actress, men associated with theatre use the theatre actresses to make their estranged wives
jealous so as to woo them back. Do you agree with her argument? Why? Why not?</h4>
Yes I agree with her argument. A men associated with theatre mostly have an ordinary, simple-minded and timid wife
who can be easily deceived by the false story. In the act too, Alfred was hiding in the actress’s room so as
to regain the love he had for her by doing things to get her jealous. Thus, men take advantage of the cunning
actress to make their estranged wives jealous so as to woo them back.
<br>
<br>
<h4>d. How does Famous Actress make a fool of Earnest Young Woman?</h4>
Famous Actress makes a fool of Earnest Young Woman by saying that a misunderstanding may have arrived between her
and her husband. She makes Earnest Young Woman believe that her husband has been playing with her to make her
jealous and gain her love back. Then, the Earnest Young woman innocently realizes her misdeed and begs sorry with
her.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    e. The conversation between the two women takes place on the stage of the theatre. What role does the theatre house
    as a part of setting play in A Matter for Husband?
</h4>
The scene is a drawing room and the design and colorings are exotic and suggestive of the apartment of the famous
Hungarian actress in which this dialogue takes place. When the curtain rises the Earnest Young Woman is discovered,
poised nervously on the edge of a gilt chair. It is plain she has been sitting there a long time. For perhaps the
fiftieth time she is studying the furnishings of the room and regarding the curtained door with a glance that would
be impatient if it were not so palpably frightened. At last the Famous Actress enters through the curtained door at
the right which leads to her boudoir.
<br>
<br>
<h4>f. What do you think about the ending of the play?</h4>
The ending of this play ‘A Matter of Husbands’ is totally perfect. And it is quiet justify the ending of
the play .The writer does the ending of this play is very pertness. He finishes all the nonplus of the character of
the play. All the characters are satisfied to one another. The film actress and advocate are very satisfied in the
end of the play. They clear the hurdle between them. They ensure to her that they have no affair it is only drama
for you. In the end of the play the young woman is very happy about her husband. The film actress and the husband of
young woman live together without any obstacle. The ending of the play is too good but full of irony. The film
actress narrates to young woman that her husband really loves her but in reality he has no love for his wife. He
only cheats his wife.
<br>
<br>
So, end of the play ‘A Matter of Husbands’, we can assume that “All is well the end is
well.” Innocent people always suffer by shrewd people because they are often sincere by hearts but the cunning
people always take advantage by their innocence.
<br>

<h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
<br>
<h4>a. Write a paragraph describing your favourite actor/actress.</h4>
<br>
<p class = "my_post_title">My Favorite Actor</p>
I like Johnny Depp, an American actor known for his portrayals of unique characters, such as Captain Jack Sparrow in
“Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.” With the film’s success, it revealed new
doors and nominations for his career. The film also opened a new door for me. Since the film Johnny Depp has become
my favorite actor. I admire Depp as an actor because of his talent, generosity, and devotion. Johnny Depp is one of
the most talent actors I’ve seen. He is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of his day and age in
Hollywood. Not only is he extremely talented, but he is also a generous man. He is part of several charitable
causes. He supports Make A Wish Foundation, and donates frequent packages to the children. Johnny Depp is also a
devoted person. He is exceedingly devoted to his family. His favorite activity is to be home playing with the
children. There aren’t many actors like Johnny Depp, and I admire him even more for standing out against the
rest. He is a gifted actor, kindhearted, and a devoted person. Johnny Depp is my favorite actor, and I admire him
not only as an actor but as a person.		</div>
