        Knowledge And Wisdom
    </h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Bertrand Russell</p>

    <p>
        In <em>"Knowledge and Wisdom"</em>, Bertrand Russell explains the difference between having knowledge and being wise. 
        Knowledge involves gathering facts, information, and skills, but wisdom is about using that knowledge thoughtfully 
        and responsibly for the good of humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Russell warns that knowledge without wisdom can lead to harmful consequences. He points to historical examples 
        where scientific knowledge was used for destruction rather than improvement. Wisdom requires understanding the 
        consequences of actions, showing empathy, and being humble about the limits of our understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        True wisdom includes qualities such as kindness, foresight, and a sense of proportion — the ability to balance 
        different values and recognize what is truly important. Russell argues that while modern education often focuses 
        on specialized knowledge, it should also teach moral responsibility and critical thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, <strong>"Knowledge and Wisdom"</strong> emphasizes that wisdom is more important than mere knowledge. 
        Wisdom combines knowledge with ethical judgment, compassion, and the pursuit of the greater good for society.
    </p>

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer the following questions.</h4>
<h4>a. What are the factors that contribute to wisdom?</h4>
Russell believes that there are several factors that contribute to wisdom. The first factor is a sense of
proportion. He defines it as the capacity to take account of all the important factors in a problem and to attach to
each its due weight. The second factor focuses on awareness of the ends of human life. Russell substantiates this
factor using the example of Hegel, an eminent historian from Germany. The third factor is emancipation from personal
prejudice. Russell also stresses on the need to try and view the world with impartiality although to the view the
world with complete impartiality is impossible.
<br>
<br>
<h4>b. What message does the writer try to convey with the example of technicians?</h4>
The writer tries to tell us knowledge itself cannot save the world. Knowledge without wisdom will not benefit the
world and in some cases will even pose a serious threat to humanity. So a wise person has to have a comprehensive
view.
<br>
<br>
<h4>c. Which leaders does Russell say were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly?</h4>
Queen Elizabeth I in England, Henry IV in France and Abraham Lincoln in the United States of America were the
leaders Bertrand Russell says who were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly. Queen Elizabeth I and Henry IV
remained free from the errors of their time, being unaffected by the conflict between the Protestants and the
Catholics. Abraham Lincoln conducted a great war without ever departing from wisdom.
<br>
<br>
<h4>d. Why is wisdom needed not only in public ways, but in private life equally?</h4>
Wisdom helps to free ourselves from personal prejudices and hatred against one another. Two persons may remain
enemies because of their prejudice. One may dislike the other for imaginary faults. However, if they can be told
that we all have flaws then they may become friends. This is the matter of public life. Considering about the
private life too, we may fail in choosing the target of our life and we may not have sufficient patience and
sufficient persuasiveness. That’s why wisdom is needed not only in public ways, but in private life equally.
<br>
<br>
<h4>e. What, according to Russell, is the true aim of education?</h4>
Russell feels that wisdom can be taught as a goal of education. The message in the parable of the Good Samaritan is
that we should love our neighbour whether friend or foe. However, in many situations we miss the message in this
parable because we fail to love those who cause harm to the society. The only way to eradicate hatred is through
understanding and love. Queen Elizabeth I in England, Henry IV in France and Abraham Lincoln in the United States of
America were the leaders Russell says who were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly. Russell feels knowledge and
wisdom can be combined in the scheme of education. People should be educated to see things in relation to other
things of the world.
<br>
<br>
<h4>f. Can wisdom be taught? If so, how?</h4>
Yes wisdom can be taught as a goal of education. The message in the parable of the Good Samaritan is that we should
love our neighbour whether friend or foe. However, in many situations we miss the message in this parable because we
fail to love those who cause harm to the society. The only way to eradicate hatred is through teaching of the
wisdom. The danger of hatred and narrow-mindedness can be pointed out in the course of giving knowledge. Russell
feels knowledge and wisdom can be combined in the scheme of education. People should be educated to see things in
relation to other things of the world. They should be encouraged to think of themselves as world citizens.
<br>
<br>
<h4>g. Why does the world need more wisdom in the future?</h4>
Wisdom is needed to free ourselves from personal prejudices and hatred against one another. Two persons may remain
enemies because of their prejudice. One may dislike the other for imaginary faults. However, if they can be told
that we all have flaws then they may become friends. We can avoid hatred if we are wise. Wisdom lies in freeing
ourselves from the control of our sense organs. Our ego develops through our senses. As we grow, we give up thinking
of ourselves alone. We start thinking of other people and grow wiser and thereby help us in giving up on our ego.
Thus, the world needs more wisdom in the future.
<br><br>

<h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br>
<h4>
a. According to Russel, “The pursuit of knowledge may become harmful unless it is combined with
wisdom.”
Justify this statement.
</h4>
The essay ‘Knowledge and Wisdom’ written by Bertrand Russell talks about the need to integrate knowledge
and wisdom. He defines various ways of achieving wisdom and how knowledge without wisdom can be harmful.
<br>
<br>
Russell stresses on the importance of comprehensiveness, but at the same time says that comprehensiveness alone does
not constitute wisdom. Hegel’s philosophy was comprehensive, but was lacking in wisdom and there was prejudice
in his philosophy. Hegel wrote with great knowledge about history, but made the Germans believe that they were the
most powerful race in the whole world which led to war. Therefore, it is necessary to combine knowledge with
feelings. Men who have knowledge and have no feelings lack wisdom. We need wisdom both in public and private life.
<br><br>

<h4>b. What, according to Russell, is the essence of wisdom? And how can one acquire the very essence?</h4>
Russell believes that it is unwise to pursue certain goals if it is impossible of achievement. He points out that
the essence of wisdom is to free oneself from the confinement of the physical world and the emotional world and look
beyond. He also points out that emancipation from personal prejudice makes one’s thoughts and feelings to
become less personal which contributes to wisdom.
<br>
<br>
Wisdom does not come immediately with knowledge. According to Russell, wisdom is defined as the practical
application and use of the knowledge to create value. One can acquire the very essence through learning and
practical experience, not just memorization.
<br><br>

<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>a. Why is wisdom necessary in education? Discuss.</h4>
Wisdom is necessary in education because with every increase of knowledge and skill, wisdom becomes more necessary.
If wisdom is inculcated it helps us realise our purposes whether it is unwise or not. Wisdom is needed to free
ourselves from personal prejudices and hatred against one another. Two persons may remain enemies because of their
prejudice. One may dislike the other for imaginary faults. However, if they can be told that we all have flaws then
they may become friends.
<br>
<br>
We can avoid hatred if we learn how to be wise. Wisdom lies in freeing ourselves from the control of our sense
organs. Our ego develops through our senses. As we grow, we give up thinking of ourselves alone. We start thinking
of other people and grow wiser and thereby help us in giving up on our ego. The danger of hatred and
narrow-mindedness can be pointed out in the course of giving knowledge. Therefore, there is the great necessity of
wisdom in education.
<br><br>

<h4>b. How can you become wise? Do you think what you are doing in college contributes to wisdom?</h4>
Wisdom is something that’s hard to define and yet somehow we know it when we see it. The wise people stay calm
in a crisis. They recognize the limits of their own knowledge, consider alternative perspectives, and remember that
the world is always changing.
<br>
<br>
Becoming wiser is not a matter of night. Patience and discipline are the key to become wiser. Wise reasoning is
associated with a whole lot of positives: higher life satisfaction, fewer negative feelings, better relationships
and less depressive rumination. A wise man commits mistakes. You learn by your own mistakes. It’s necessary to
remember that the more you commit mistakes the more you learn and the more you improve. Staying happy is also a step
to become wiser. No matter what happens in your life, just be happy, keep the faith and solve the problems calmly. A
wise man is never afraid of any situations. He/she work peacefully to solve the problem. I think this are the
certain ways to become wise.		</div>
