    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><em>"Trifles"</em> by Susan Glaspell is a one-act play that explores themes of gender roles, justice, and the perception of women in early 20th-century society. The play is set in a rural farmhouse where a woman named Mrs. Wright has been arrested for the murder of her husband, Mr. Wright. The sheriff, his wife, the county attorney, and a few others arrive at the farmhouse to investigate the crime and search for evidence. While the men search for obvious clues to prove Mrs. Wright's guilt, the women—Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters—are left to inspect the domestic spaces, where they begin to notice small details that the men overlook, dismissing them as “trifles.” 

            The play’s central tension arises from the contrasting ways in which the male and female characters perceive the situation. The men believe that the key to solving the case lies in finding concrete, physical evidence, such as fingerprints or a weapon, and dismiss the women’s observations as irrelevant. However, as Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters investigate further, they begin to piece together a story about Mrs. Wright’s unhappy life. They discover that Mrs. Wright had been isolated, emotionally abused by her husband, and had once enjoyed singing—until her husband killed her pet bird, which had been her only source of joy. This act of cruelty, they realize, may have triggered her decision to murder her husband.
            
            As the women continue to explore the house, they find the dead bird’s body hidden in Mrs. Wright’s sewing box, its neck broken. This discovery serves as the crucial piece of evidence that reveals Mrs. Wright’s motive: she may have killed her husband in a moment of rage after the bird’s death, which symbolized her own suffocating existence under her husband's control. By the end of the play, the women understand the motive but choose not to reveal their findings to the men. They silently decide to protect Mrs. Wright, recognizing that the law may not offer her the justice she deserves, given the circumstances of her life. 
            
            "Trifles" highlights the underestimation of women’s intellect and the importance of their domestic knowledge in a male-dominated society. The title of the play, "Trifles," refers to how the men dismiss the women’s contributions, but it ultimately is the women’s attention to the “trifles”—small, seemingly insignificant details—that uncovers the truth. The play critiques societal norms and presents a commentary on how women’s experiences, often seen as insignificant or trivial, can hold great value in understanding the deeper truths of a situation. In the end, "Trifles" becomes a powerful statement about gender inequality, justice, and the recognition of women’s roles in both the private and public spheres.</p>

    	<h3>Understanding the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer the following questions.</h4>
<br>
<h4>a. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain.</h4>
Yes, I believed that Mrs. Wright killed her husband. After listening to the conversation of two womens they were comparing Mrs. Wright before marriage life and after marriage life. By this we can understand that Mrs. Wright had very wonderful life before marriage and after marriage, her life was boring. She couldn&#8217;t sing talk to anybody, depressed and her bird was killed by her husband. So, in case of revenge she killed her husband.
<br><br>

<h4>b. Do you think Mr. Wright&rsquo;s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn&rsquo;t stopped by
the Wrights&rsquo; home?</h4>
No, I don&#8217;t think Mr. Wright&#8217;s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn&#8217;t stopped by the Wright&#8217;s home because ifMr. Hale hadn&#8217;t stopped by the Wrights&#8217; home, nobody would ever know about Mr. Wright&#8217;s death as the location of the house was quite far from the road and the news of his death will remain suppressed.
<br><br>

<h4>
c. Why does Mrs. h4Hale think that Mrs. Wright&rsquo;s worries about her preserves indicate her
innocence?
</h4>
 Mrs. Hale suggests think that Mrs. Wright’s worries about her preserves indicate her innocence because she did not feel happy and she contrasts Mrs. Ale saying that only an innocent woman would ask for an apron and a shout while worrying about fruit. So because of this, Mrs. Ale thinks that Mrs. Wright&#8217;s worries about her preserves indicate her innocent.
<br><br>

<h4>d. How does Mrs. Peters&rsquo; homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright?</h4>
Mrs. Peter end up protecting Minnie Wright by hiding the strangled canary, which could be used as key evidence against her. Although Mrs. Peter&#8217;s is the sheriff&#8217;s wife and married to the law she comes to the same conclusion as Mrs. Wright and ultimately acting on her behalf. In this way Mrs. Peter&#8217;s home steading experience connects her to Mrs. Wright.
<br><br>

<h4>e. How do the women&rsquo;s perspectives on men differ?</h4>
The woman&#8217;s perspectives on men differ by the fact that the mens are powerful and have become stupid and lazy but the women have no power except that of intelligence, which allows them to manipulate the men.

Being in a rural landscape, the characters are meant to represent real people. And although this is a set in American&#8217;s heartland, the relatively larger distance between neighbours in rural farming areas implies a sense of loneliness that parallels Mrs. Wright’s loneliness.
