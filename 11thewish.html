    <h2>The Wish</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Roald Dahl</p>

        <p>
          "The Wish" is a short psychological story by Roald Dahl that captures the intense imagination of a young boy. 
          It portrays a child's imaginative game turning into a suspenseful and thrilling adventure. The story takes place 
          in a house where a boy, lying alone, invents a game for himself. He imagines that the colorful carpet before him 
          is a dangerous terrain where different colors represent life and death challenges.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          According to his imagination, the black patches on the carpet are dangerous snakes, the red patches are burning fire, 
          and the yellow patches are safe zones. If he steps on black or red, he would "die." 
          Motivated by the desire to win and to prove his bravery, the boy sets off carefully, moving across the "safe" zones 
          and avoiding the "deadly" ones.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          As he progresses, the journey becomes more intense and dangerous. At one point, he is stuck in a tricky situation where 
          he has no easy escape. His heart races, and the fear becomes overwhelming. Just as he is about to fall onto a black patch, 
          the story ends, leaving the readers in suspense and uncertainty about his fate.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Through the vivid imagination of the child, Dahl effectively captures the innocence, fear, and daring spirit of childhood. 
          The story symbolizes the challenges and risks that one faces in life, and how courage and imagination help overcome them.
        </p>
      
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong>  
          The story highlights the power of imagination, the nature of childhood fears, and the thin line between fantasy and reality. 
          It also subtly reflects on the human tendency to set self-created challenges and the bravery needed to confront them.

flipped it with his finger.
<br>
<br>
<h4>b. What kind of effect did the carpet have on the child?</h4>
 The child became extremely amazed to see the red carpet. He had never really notice it before in such a
way. The different colors of carpet seemed to brighten mysteriously and spring out at him in a most dazzling way. He
was thoroughly lost in those colors and his imagination.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h4>e. What did the child see as he looked down on the black patterns of the carpet?</h4>
The child saw different colours brightening mysteriously. He was lost in different colours&#8217; spots. He kept
on thinking in his imagination about the colours and their different forms. Hence, the child saw the poisonous snake
with the oily body of snake arising to catch or bite him as he looked down on the black patterns of the carpet.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br>
<h4>a. The writer creates two voices in the story. Who are they?</h4>
 Yes, the writer creates two voices in the story and they were (a narrator) and the voice of the young boy i.e. the child.
<br>
<br>
<h4>b. Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow. </h4>
<i>
&ldquo;&#8230;the black parts are
snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks around the middle, and if I
touch one of them, I&#8217;ll be bitten and I&#8217;ll die before tea time. And if I get across safely, without
being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow.&rdquo;
</i>
<br>
<br>
<h4>i. What does &lsquo;the black part&rsquo; mean?</h4>
The black part means the difficulty, challenges and suffering in the journey.
<br>
<br>
<h4>ii. Who is the speaker?</h4>
The speaker is a young boy.
<br>
<br>
<h4>iii. Why doesn&rsquo;t the speaker want to be burnt?</h4>
He doesn&rsquo;t want to be burnt because he wants to reach across the carpet safely to receive
the gift &lsquo;a puppy&rsquo; on his birthday.
<br><br>

<h4>c. Which images and metaphors are used in the story?</h4>
The main metaphor in the story &#8220;The Wish&#8221; by Roald Dahl is the child&#8217;s journey along the carpet as a
representation of the obstacles and challenges he faces as he matures. Vivid images that Dahl uses to reinforce the
metaphor include the scab as the boy&#8217;s primary challenge, the red spots on the carpet as hot lumps of coal, and the
black sections as evil poisonous snakes.
<br><br>

<h4>d. Summarize the short story &ldquo;The Wish&rdquo; in about 200 words.</h4>
(Look at top of the page)
<br>
<br>
<h4>
e. The story shows the events through the eyes of the narrator and the child. Comparing the two styles,
who presents a more interesting or effective view for the readers? Why?
</h4>
In &#8220;The Wish,&#8221; a boy uses his imagination to travel across a red, black, and yellow carpet. The child&#8217;s
represents the story in more interesting and effective than the narrator&#8217;s, because it is vivid and suspenseful. The
child was a in a hardship situation and he faces hardships and won all the challenges as motivated by a Birthday
gift as a puppy by completing his journey at the end.
<br><br>

<h4>
f. Is &ldquo;The Wish&rdquo; a story about self-confidence overcoming fear or about greed? Give your
arguments.
</h4>
Roald Dahl&#8217;s &#8220;The Wish&#8221; is about self-confidence overcoming fear rather than about greed aa it is all about
self-confidence and overcoming fear. Admittedly, &#8220;greed,&#8221; the desire for a puppy, is a motivating factor. However,
the puppy motivator is a fantasy that boy has made up to help him overcome his fear of crossing the treacherous
carpet. He says to himself, ‘if I get across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a
puppy for my birthday tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
The child seems fearful while watching his scab. He thinks much about picking it. He raises many questions with
himself. He picks out his scab being panic. But when he sees the carpet his fear increases high. He gathers his
confidence to cross the carpet. He creates his obstacles supposing the colours as coals and snakes. He even puts his
goal across the carpet. He moves on bravely on the carpet wishing for a puppy on his birthday as a birthday gift. He
tries his best to overcome his fear. His self-confidence and his wish end as he falls down in black colours.
<br>
<br>
Even the puppy becomes part of his project of overcoming fears to achieve a goal: But the fear of not getting the
puppy compelled him to go on. This tale enters into the mind of an imaginative child and reflects the child&#8217;s
ability to turn something as common place as a patterned carpet into a scene of adventure and challenge in which he
can act out his fears in a safe environment.
<br><br><br>

<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>a. Do you think our wish can be fulfilled? Why or why not?</h4>
Having wishes is significant in itself. But not all the wants, desire and wishes are fulfilled. We need
hard and complicated practice to fulfil our wish, want, desire, and interest. If a wish comes true, it is one of the
most beautiful things on earth. It is, therefore, essential to deal constructively with the obstacles on the way to
your wish. Some of the common hurdles that stops us from fulfilling our wishes are:
<br>
<br>
&#8211; I have no money for it / I don’t want to spend my money on it
<br>
&#8211; I want to, but I don’t have time for it /I’m too caught up in my everyday life
<br>
&#8211; I’m scared. Fear of failure. Afraid of making the wrong decision. Afraid to disappoint other people
<br>
&#8211; I have doubts whether it is right for me
<br>
<br>
So to fulfill our wishes we should deal with above mentioned problems. For this we can do the following things:
<br><br>
&#8211; Try to realize the wish in the small version. Try to satisfy the need behind the wish.
<br>
&#8211; Trick everyday life and proceed in small steps.
<br>
&#8211; Address fears and debunk them as much as possible.
<br>
&#8211; Create clarity. Get a clear picture of where we want to go.
<br>
&#8211; Strengthen self-image so that our wishes becomes possible.
<br><br>

<h4>
b. Why do you think some people might have a frightening nature? What would you suggest to them to
overcome it?
</h4>
Some people might have a frightening nature due to the lack of self-confidence and being less sociable. Some people, especially innocent ones easily lose their confidence as they face obstacles in their paths of life.
<br>
<br>
I would suggest the following points to overcome it:
<br>
&#8211; Learn more about your fear, this first step can be the hardest one but it&#8217;s also absolutely
necessary.
<br>
&#8211; Use your imagination in positive ways.
<br>
&#8211; Use your brain in a different way than usual.
<br>
&#8211; Focus on your breathing.
<br>
&#8211; Practice mindfulness.
<br>
&#8211; Use nature as your therapist.
