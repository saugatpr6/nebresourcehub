    <h2>Soft Storm</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Poet:</strong> Abhi Subedi</p>

        <p>
            The poem <em>"Soft Storm"</em> by Abhi Subedi captures the inner emotional disturbance of the speaker as he walks through 
            a society affected by political turmoil, injustice, and human suffering. Rather than an external, violent storm, 
            the "soft storm" represents the poet’s quiet but powerful feelings of sadness, anger, and compassion.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Observing the struggles of ordinary people — beggars, street children, displaced individuals — and the exploitation 
            by those in power, the poet experiences a deep emotional response. Yet he also witnesses small signs of hope, 
            kindness, and resilience that offer a sense of optimism amid the sadness.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The poem portrays the internal conflict of the poet: the sorrow for the suffering people, the anger at injustice, 
            and the longing for peace and healing. The "soft storm" is a reminder to remain sensitive and empathetic rather 
            than becoming numb to the world’s pain.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Through emotional language and vivid imagery, Abhi Subedi urges readers to value compassion, conscience, and 
            quiet strength in the face of hardship and violence. <strong>"Soft Storm"</strong> ultimately calls for hope, awareness, 
            and human solidarity in troubled times.
        </p>

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer the following questions.</h4>
<h4>a. When does the speaker grow soft? Enlist the occasions when he grows soft?</h4>
The poem &#8216;soft storm&#8217; composed by Abhi Subedi is filled with a touch of compassion and investigates the insanities
of tumultuous times. The speaker has said he grows soft when:
<br>
• He hears the tumult of earth.
<br>
• The sky grew like crocuses
<br>
• The moon skids down
<br>
• The moon sang of lampposts and gutters in this seamless city.
<br>
<br>
<h4>b. What do you understand by ‘this seamless city’?</h4>
I understand the term &#8220;this seamless city&#8221; as a place that is free from all forms of disturbance, free
from awkward transitions, and indications. The city, from boundaries and full of freedom for human choices.
<br>
<br>
<h4>c. Describe the poor children portrayed in the poem.</h4>
In the poem, the poor and homeless children seen in Thamel are portrayed. They were hungry and crying with hunger
under the bat-bearing tree at kesharmahal.
<br>
<br>
<h4>d. What do you understand by ‘the unwedded gardens of history’?</h4>
The term &#8216;unwedded gardens of history&#8217; signifies the culture and history of the Kathmandu valley that has been
ignored for a long time.
<br>
<br>
<h4>e. Why was the forlorn child wailing?</h4>
The forlorn child portrayed in the poem was wailing to find his mother in the corridors of violent history.
<br>
<br>
<h4>f. What do you understand about ‘soft storm’?</h4>
The term &#8216; soft storm&#8217; signifies its meaning itself by presenting the concept of a storm that is soft or smooth. In
this poem, the poet&#8217;s disturbed feelings that are not disastrous are generalized by the term &#8216;soft storm&#8217;.
<br>
<br>
<h4>g. Why does the speaker call our time ‘mad time’?</h4>
The speaker points out time as mad time because the speaker finds out the disturbing mixture of destruction. The
narrator finds unusual and selfish behaviour of people. People are mannerless and their activities are unlawful.
Their thoughts and actions are reasonable with stupidity. Modern people are trying to dominate and keep themselves
up with materialism.
<br>
<br>
The speaker observes the activities like stones growing on flowers, rhododendrons blooming in winter, the earth is
full of tumults in the song of the birds, moon hums melodies, history rashes under the lampposts, and birds share
the bizarre journey over the warming earth. Thus the speaker claims mad time.
<br><br>
<h4>h. What does the speaker want to do in “hard times”?</h4>
The poet wants to melt like a rainbow in “hard times&#8221;.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br>
<h4>
a. The poet uses the word ‘soft’ with the words like ‘storm’ and ‘gale’,
which
generally refer to disorder and violence. What effect does the poet achieve through the use of such anomalous
expressions?
</h4>
The poem &#8216;soft storm&#8217; composed by Abhi Subedi expresses the touch of compassion and the inner disturbance of the
poet. The title itself glorifies the emotions of the poet as they were disturbed but yet not disastrous.
<br>
<br>
In the poem, the speaker uses the word &#8216;soft&#8217; with the words like &#8216;storm&#8217; and &#8216;gale&#8217; to express his inner
disturbance. Generally, the anomalous expression refers to the syntactically well-formed but semantically
meaningless. In the poem, the expressions ‘soft storm’ and ‘softness rose like a gale’ are
unusual and paradoxical. They are used to define the psychological effect of a speaker. By connecting such ideas,
the poet is trying to achieve the ability to express his inner state through psychology.
<br><br>

<h4>b. What is the speaker’s attitude towards the time he describes in the poem?</h4>
The speaker expresses his thoughts toward the time by using the term &#8216; mad time&#8217;. He considers the time to be mad as
he experiences different unusual things and unlawful activities. The things happening around him were unusual and
mannerless. Society is in complete disorder and mannerless. Also, he observes that modern society is out of control
and it gives him inner disturbance so his attitude toward the time seems not to be positive.
<br>
<br>

<h4>c. What is the speaker like? Is he a rebel? Why? Why not?</h4>
The poem &#8216;soft storm&#8217; describes the inner emotion of the speaker when he observes modern society. With the touch of
compassion, the speaker reveals the tumultuous nature and describes what he feels. The poet finds our society in
complete disorder. Society and people are suffering from corruption. People with hunger are seen everywhere in the
streets. He witnesses modern people ignoring glorious history.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, most things are unusual and unlawful. People are forgetting about humanity and are behaving
inhumanely with each other. They have forgotten the mutual respect and sympathy. In the poem, the poet seems to
challenge these things. So we can call him a rebel though his rebellious nature is not directly presented.
<br><br>

<h4>d. Explain the stanza below in your own words:</h4>
<i>
I became soft
<br>
when I saw
<br>
a blood-stained shirt
<br>
speaking in the earth’s ears
<br>
with bruised human lips
<br>
in the far corner
<br>
under the moon
<br>
of history and dreams
<br>
playing hide and seek
<br>
in open museums
<br>
of human times.
</i>
<br>
<br>
The above lines are extracted from the fourth stanza of the poem &#8216;soft storm&#8217; composed by Abhi Subedi. As the title
glorifies, the poem describes his inner emotion using anomalous expression. He seems to be rebellious indirectly to
the unlawful activities of modern society.
<br>
<br>
Through the above lines, the poet expresses his suffering from uneasy feelings when he observes a person in
miserable condition during the night. When he sees a person with a blood-stained shirt during the night, he
experiences the inner soft storm inside him. In the poem, the person is lying unconsciously on the ground in the
moonlit night. Here, human dreams and achievements are presented by the moon of history. When the moon appears in
the sky, the moonlight falls on a place of cultural and historical importance. Through this natural interplay during
the night, the poet describes people who are indifferent to the injured person who might be the victim of violence.
<br>
<br>
Through this natural interplay during the night, it seems people are indifferent to the injured person who might be
the victim of violence.
