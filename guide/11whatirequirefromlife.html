    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Explain the following lines with reference to the context:</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>a. &ldquo;The satisfaction of adventure is something much more solid than a thrill.&rdquo;</h4>The author believes that adventure is not only about emotions, but also about satisfaction in performing a creative activity. It enriches people with solid experience. He compares thrill with amusement he has got from reading Rimbaud&#8217;s poetry. He served on the war front in Madrid for six months and looked forward to read a book of Rimbaud&#8217;s poetry for a thrill.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>
    b. &ldquo;I want the workers to see the fruit of their own work not in profits for others, but in their
    own and their friends&rsquo; well-being.&rdquo;
    </h4>The line shows the writer&#8217;s support for socialism. He asserts the hardworking should be rewarded directly to a considerable extent. He wants democracy within the working environment. He is a socialist who wants industry to be controlled by the workers. They should be free to work and share profit among themselves too. He compares the nature of industrial work with hunting and gardening like of paleothitic and neolithitic. To create an even and pleasing working atmosphere the profits of work should remain among working people.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>c. Why do you think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers?</h4>I think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosopher like Aristotle, Lord Blan, Mr. Dash, and Sir John Asterisk to support his ideas and convince the readers about his idea of decent work and death.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>d. Discuss the essay in terms of its language, purpose, subject, point of view and mode of writing.</h4>The language is simple and lucid in the essay. Haldane&#8217;s style is typically straight forward and vigorous. As a science popularize, he is accustomed to write about complex maters in a simple language so that any reader can understand. Here, when writing on a non- technical subject, he retains this simplicity, with short, forceful, declarative sentences and clear explanations.
    <br><br>
    His subject at first appears to be personal and thus made of writing descriptive. However, in the second part of his essay, it becomes clear that he is putting forward a political argument freedom, for instance not merely a personal preference of Haldane&#8217;s but a universal requirement. This means that society should be structured in such a way as to maximize freedom for everyone. 
    <br><br>
    His viewpoint is that of a social critic, setting forth a general program of the principles that should underlie to a civilized society. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>a. What do you require from your life to be happy and satisfied?</h4>I require good health, a job, friendship, freedom &#038; security from my life to be happy and satisfied.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>b. What is socialism? How is it different from capitalism?</h4>Socialism is a system of social and economic equality in which private property and ownership are not prioritized. It differs from capitalism because capitalism does not provide economic equality. Unlike socialism, capitalism ignores people&#8217;s needs and does not promote equal opportunity.
    <br><br>
    
    <h4>c. Write an essay about your dream house.</h4>
    <p class="my_post_title">My Dream House</p>
    My dream house is an ideal house that I always imagine. House becomes home when we pour love to our family members. It is a place where different generation live together in a single bond. So, my dream house will be full of love and happiness.
    <br><br>
    I always dream of a mountainous wooden home. My ideal home should be facing a river. Through the windows, I could watch the mountains sunset and vanish. It should be facing East direction because I want to enjoy cool air as well as rising sun view. My ideal home would include a little garden with my own veggies and fruits.
    <br><br>
    I would like to maintain my house neat and clean. There will be a meditation room for myself to do Yoga and meditation. I will also make one library room for my family and visitors. I will make a special room for my parents and visitors.I won’t add too much amenities in my dream house because it creates laziness. I believe that physical exercises are necessary to be healthy and fit. There will be solar panel in my house to maintain regular light. I will also add a big smart TV for my parents and visitors. My house’s wall will be decorated with beautiful wall paintings capturing nature’s true beauty. I also have a 1 year old pet dog named Puppy. I also want a modest but cozy area in Puppy’s home where he may sleep and rest when he gets old.
    <br><br>
    My dream home is a place of joy, peace and beauty. Right now it exists only in my dreams. But someday, it will become a reality.
