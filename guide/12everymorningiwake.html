<br>
<br>
<h4>d. What does Milk Wood sound like? A type of wood or a place? Why?</h4>
Milk Wood sounds like a place because there is no use of article before this noun. If it is a type of wood then an
article either &#8216;a&#8217;, &#8216;an&#8217; or &#8216;the&#8217; must have been used according to grammatical rules.
<br>
<br>
<h4>e. Why do the inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun ‘but just for now’?</h4>
The inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun ‘but just for now’ because they know that they are not permanent

The God is the creator of all beings. The God is immortal and all creatures are created and destroyed by him. The
remote of all creatures life is in the hand of the God. A king, a billionaire and a scientist are nothing in front

<h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
<br>
<h4>a. Does the God exist? Give your opinion.</h4>
&#8220;Does God exist?&#8221; is a controversial topic which has been discussed since the beginning of human civilization.
It depends upon our belief. Some people believe in the existence if the God and some do not. In my opinion, the God
exists. The God live in our mind. The existence of God is like the existence of radiation. We just see the effects
of it. We don&#8217;t see God but we find effects in our lives. Unexpected and miraculous things are the example of the
existence of God. Although there is no physical presence of God but the God exists in our sub conscious mind. Hence
god exists upon us and he is immortal and intangible.
