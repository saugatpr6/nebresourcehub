    <h2>A Respectable women</h2>
    <h3>summary</h3>
    <h4><br>A Respectable Woman by Kate Chopin was initially published in Vogue Magazine in the year 1894. This story has presented a set on a sugar plantation in Louisiana. This is the story of a woman struggling to understand her desires.<br>

        Mrs. Baroda was unhappy to hear about Gouvernail’s visit to their plantation. Her husband Gaston’s information about Gouvernail made her upset because she had planned to take a rest and converse after their busy winter and mild separation. She hadn’t met Gouvernail before and only heard about him through her husband.<br>
        
        Mrs. Baroda unconsciously pictured him to be slim, tall, cynical with eyeglasses and hands into his pockets. She didn’t like him in her imagination. When Gouvernail arrived and presented himself, Mrs. Baroda was fascinated by him. But she found him quite different in various aspects. He was quite different from her husband’s description. She became quite puzzled and exhausted to find Gouvernail’s simple and reserved personality.<br>
        
        Gouvernail behaved quite simply and didn’t pay much attention to Mrs. Baroda. Mrs. Baroda found various lacks within him. She also discussed his reserved nature with her husband. She even tried to avoid him but there was no change in Gouvernail’s nature. She walked along with him to change his reserved nature.<br>
        
        One night, she was sitting on a bench alone. She planned to leave the plantation for a while. In the meantime, Gouvernail arrived there and sat just beside her. He provided her with a scarf on Gaston’s behalf. He started talking about the nighttime, the olden days and his liking for peaceful living. <br>
        
        Mrs. Baroda found him talkative for the first time. She didn’t listen to his words but felt attracted to his voice’s tones. She wanted to reach out her hand towards him and touch his face or lips with her sensitive tips of fingers. She wanted to whisper on his cheek. But she controlled herself. <br>
        
        Her self- dignity of being a respectable woman and wife prevented her doing this great mistake. She stood and left the place. Next, she delighted her husband saying that she had overcome everything and she will treat Gouvernail very nicely the next time.

<h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br>
<h4>
a. What is the cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda’s mind? What role does Mrs. Baroda ‘being a
respectable woman’ play in the story?
</h4>
The cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda&#8217;s mind is her attraction towards Gouvernail and the fear of society. Being a respectable woman Mrs. Baroda controls her feeling and let the social norms win. She was so attracted to her husbandâ€™s friend Gouvernail, she wanted to touch his face, lips with her sensitive fingers but she doesn&#8217;t do that and controls herself being a respectable woman.
<br><br>


<h4>b. Sketch the character of Gouvernail and contrast it with Gaston.</h4>
Gouvernail is the Mr. Barodaâ€™s college friend who came to spend a week or two in his friendsâ€™ sugar plantation. Gouvernail is a slim and attractive man. He doesn&#8217;t wear eyeglasses and he is so lovable and inoffensive. He is a silent guy and loves peace. He neither frank nor too chatty. He loves to sit on portico and enjoy the cool air with cigar. He accepts what Baroda couple gives and doesn&#8217;t demand anything. Some characters of Mrs. Baroda and his friend Gouvernail are just opposite. Mr. Baroda is so frank and chatty but Gouvernail is too silent. Gouvernail smokes but Mr. Baroda does not. It can be said that Mr. Baroda is extrovert and more sociable man whether in contrast Gouvernail is introvert and less sociable man.
<br><br>


<h4>c. Why does Mrs. Baroda not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband?</h4>
There are some battles in life which a human being must fight alone. Mrs. Baroda was a respectable woman and if she discloses her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband, it may cause a serious problem. A husband never likes his wife being attracted to another man. Many husbands have given divorce to their wives after knowing that they are attracted towards other man. Moreover, if she reveals her feelings the friendship of Mr. Baroda and Gouvernail may weaken. That&#8217;s why Mrs. Baroda does not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband.
<br><br>


<h4>
d. The last three sentences of the story bring a kind of twist. After reading these three sentences, how
do you analyze Mrs. Baroda’s attitude towards Gouvernail?
</h4>
The last three sentences of the story bring a kind of twist. Mrs. Baroda liked Gouvernail but due to the fear of society and fear of loss of her respect she didn&#8217;t want Gouvernail to come in their house. But last she proposed, wholly from herself, to have Gouvernail visit them again. She said to her husband, &#8220;I have overcome everything! You will see. This time I shall be very nice to him&#8221;. After reading this I think Mrs. Baroda has overcome the fear of society. And now, she will not control herself and will flow with her emotion. I think she will do everything what her heart wants to do with Gouvernail as she has said that she will be nice to him. In another point of view, we can say that she has overcome her feelings and emotions towards Gouvernail and will be normal to him.
<br><br>


<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
<br>
<h4>
a. The entry of an outsider into a family has been a recurring subject in both literature and films.
Narrate a story real or imaginative where an outsider’s arrival destroys the intimate relationship
between the husband and the wife and causes break up in marital relationship without direct fault of
anyone. Anton’s Chekhov’s story ‘About Love’ is a story on this subject.
</h4>
The story of &#8220;About Love&#8221; has been written by a Russian writer Anton Chekhov. &#8220;About
Love&#8221; is a story about love affairs. Here in this story, the third love story somewhat reflects the
same ideas as seen in the story of Kate Chopin&#8217;s &#8220;A Respectable Woman&#8221;.
<br><br>

The third story has presented the love story of the major character Alyohin and Anna, the wife of
Dimitry Luganovich.
<br><br>

When Alyohin is elected for honorary justice of the peace, he has to go to town for work. There he meets
another judge whose name is Dimitry Luganovich. Once he goes to the house of Luganovich to have dinner.
There he meets Anna Luganovich, the wife of Dimitry Luganovich. The beauty, youth and intelligence of
Anna attract him. Alyohin’s mind is disturbed by Anna’s memory. He starts meeting with her.
They pass time together for hours. They share gifts. They go to the theatre and also share their joys
and sorrows. Alyohin falls in love with her, but his morals and thoughts stop him to express his love
openly. As a result, Anna suffers from mental tiredness. Both of them suffer a lot due to middle-class
moralities. But later on, Alyohin sees the illusion that Anna enjoys her life and doesn’t pay
attention to him. Due to their relationship, Anna suffers from mental tiredness. Finally, the Luganovich
family has to move. Alyohin goes to say goodbye to Anna inside the train. When their eyes meet for the
last time, both cry and hug each other. Alyohin kisses Anna and expresses his deep love. Finally, both
separate from each other because Anna is leaving for Creamea for her treatment.
<br><br>


<h4>
b. Mrs. Baroda makes an expectation about Gouvernail even before meeting him. Suppose you are a mature
girl/boy and your family members are giving you pressure for getting married. Write in about 200 words
describing what qualities you would like to get in your future husband/wife.
</h4>
Marriage is a sacred relationship between two people. Simply, it is the union of two people that creates a family tie and carries legal, social or religious rights and responsibilities. It is a lifetime decision and should be taken carefully as our whole life will depend on the decision we take today. Before marriage, we need to think as well as know about the person with whom we are going to get married. It is a lifelong relationship that&#8217;s why we have to choose a perfect life partner.
