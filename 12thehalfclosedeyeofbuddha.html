<br>
<br>
  <h4>b. According to the tourist, why is the West indebted to the East?</h4>
 Tourists insist that the west is indebted to the east because the west has provided different civilizations through Puranas, brass- figures and ivory decorations. In addition, the manuscripts of palm leaves, copperplate inscriptions and ornaments of the west have a different value and this fascinates the west.

 The difference between the paralyzed child and his sister as mentioned in the story are:

<br>
  Paralyzed child (boy) is very sick as his whole body is useless; he cannot speak, he can’t move his hands, he can’t chew his food, or even spit. His body is not in the situation of heeding commands from his brain. The thing that indicates himself alive is his eyes. 
<br>
<br>
  Meanwhile, his sister is quite fine as her whose body functions properly work. She crawls around, picking up everything she comes across and putting it into her mouth, knocking over the beer, overturning the cooking stone.

<br>
<h3>Reference to the Context</h3> 
<br>
  <h4> a. Which narrative technique is used by the author to tell the story? How is this story different from other stories you have read? </h4>
 The author uses the technique of ‘stream of consciousness technique’ in this story. This story is different from other stories I read ever now because of the appearance of double views on the story which shows the good and bad aspects. Unlike other many stories where the author writes only about the event of the story from one side but if you read this story, it deals with the monologues of two characters a tourist guide of Kathmandu valley and a foreign tourist. in other many conventional stories, I read ever follow the stream of awareness techniques where a narrator shows the action and events through fictional characters or other ways. 
<br>
<br>
  <h4>b. How is the author able to integrate two fragments of the narration into a unified whole?</h4>
 The author is able to integrate two fragments of the narration into a unified whole by providing the insights and examples of different eyes, views, experiences and linking them to two different aspects. The author shows the reality of Nepalese(eastern) poverty and sympathetic aspect which the western not see from their eyes and doesn’t capture from their camera nor write in their books. They only see the upper beauty of the Himalayas and green forests. But they don’t understand and feel the inner reality of the eastern and their pain suffocated in the poverty and the life spent in lacking. The author shows the hardship, diseases that the people face in the community. The tourist only pictures the things of beauty But a guide makes her see the things of reality and sympathetic pain. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
  <b>Cultural, tradition, and art crafts:</b> it is mentioned in the story that easterner had given many things to Westerners; Puranas, images of brass and ornaments of ivory, manuscripts of palm leaves and inscriptions on copperplate and also civilization and many musical instruments. If we destroy all the history books then these are things which would again create a new tradition, religion, and culture and made us rich in culture, tradition, religion, and air crafts. 
<br>
<br>
  <b>The gaze of monks and nuns:</b> The story shows the gaze of monks and nuns who received alms and spread the law in the nooks and fissures of the Kasthamandap with ‘the samyak gaze’. This is a sight that perceives everything in its purest form.
